# DeepSeek: A New AI Challenger in 2025

I found this fascinating article about DeepSeek, an emerging player in the AI industry: [DeepSeek: What You Need to Know About the New AI Challenger](https://medium.com/@kanerika/deepseek-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-ai-challenger-d91611b4b1f8)

What I find particularly interesting about this development is how DeepSeek is challenging the status quo in AI development through its open-source approach and cost efficiency. The fact that they developed their R1 model for just $6 million, compared to the hundreds of millions spent by larger companies, demonstrates that innovative AI development doesn't always require massive budgets.

The article's discussion about DeepSeek's various models and their performance metrics is especially relevant as we see more competition in the AI landscape. It's encouraging to see how open-source models are advancing and potentially surpassing proprietary ones, which could lead to more accessible and transparent AI development in the future.

I agree that Deepseek's influence is in challenging the status quo that was building up around OpenAI which is pretty closed. It gives a sense of competition. Open-source models in my opinion are definitely going to be even more vibrant after this as others perhaps try to build upon or follow. We will have to see, but it seems potentially interesting to watch the open-source scene develop.
